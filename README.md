> **Project Overview:** A statistical analysis of the UK Annual Population Survey (APS) dataset to explore relationships between [Variable A] and [Variable B], accounting for survey response bias.

## 🎯 Objectives
*   **Data Cleaning:** Recoded complex categorical variables for meaningful analysis.
*   **Statistical Testing:** Implemented Chi-Square tests to determine the significance of the relationship between [Variable A] and [Variable B].
*   **Bias Correction:** Applied survey reweighting techniques to account for non-random response bias and missing data.
*   **Visualization:** Created publication-standard plots using `ggplot2`.

## 🛠 Techniques Used
*   **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**
*   **Hypothesis Testing (Chi-Square)**
*   **Confidence Intervals & Reweighting**
*   **Multidimensional Analysis (3-way cross-tabulation)**

## 📂 Key Files
*   `git.md` - The full rendered report with graphs and interpretation.
*   `analysis.qmd` - The raw Quarto/R code.
